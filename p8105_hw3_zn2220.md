# Problem 1

## 1.0

### To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

Introducing data.

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart <- janitor::clean_names(instacart)
```

Monitor the data. It has 1384617 rows and 15 cols. Let’s glimpse at it
and make a slice. Some key variables and example are shown in the kable.

``` r
glimpse(instacart)
```
